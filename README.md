# Awesome iOS & Android
A curated list of awesome iOS &amp; Android frameworks, libraries and resources. Only iOS entries that have Android counterparts (and vice-versa) are listed here so as to help development of native apps on both platforms.

This list only includes native frameworks meant to be used in native iOS & Android development. Multi-platform frameworks such as (Titanium, Xamarin, etc) are of no interest here. Nowadays most apps are developed in both iOS & Android and this means that developers have to adapt to the libraries/frameworks that exist in each platform. The goal of this list is to gather all these libraries/frameworks that have iOS & Android coutnerparts so as to help the developer make the right decisions.
